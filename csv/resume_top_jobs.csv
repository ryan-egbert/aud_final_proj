We will consider drivers from all over the country.  The position open right now requires a minimum of 4 weeks out and 1 week home we have flexibility on this and it\'s possible to spend weekends home if we can route the truck through there but this is the standard.

(Countryside IL) We are a growing vintage furniture company here in Countryside with a fairly large warehouse.  Inside this warehouse we\'re frequently shuffling around a lot of inventory every day - often fragile (and expensive!) pieces of cool vintage furniture from the 50\'s 60\'s and 70\'s.  Our photo studio in-house wood shop and shipping and receiving areas are constantly needing pieces moved in and out as everyone here does their jobs.  Keeping everything moving organized and inventoried is the name of the game and if you\'re the type of person who takes pride in being strong disciplined and organized we are looking for you.  My name is Greg and if what I just described sounds like something you could come in help manage and (eventually) take control over as you move up then I would love to hear from you.  This would be from 8am-4pm (sometimes 4:30pm) Monday through Friday and there is opportunity for growth here as you gain more experience and familiarity with our warehouse the furniture itself and how it is all organized.  At the start you would be an important part of helping to make sure our daily photography and wood shop workflow goes smoothly. You would be working with our warehouse floor supervisor who knows everything here well enough to direct exactly what needs to be done and when. Eventually if you master how everything works here and help everyone stay on track you can even BE warehouse floor supervisor.  Here is what your tasks would look like at the start:  1. Every morning we must ensure there is a piece of furniture in the studio ready to go so that the photographer can get straight to work without any delay. Depending on the circumstances this might mean getting it there immediately when you arrive in the morning or having it already in place at the end of the previous day.  2. While that piece is being photographed you would be helping get the next piece ready on our list. This involves looking at our list keeping it organized going to locate the next piece in the warehouse cleaning it up so that it doesn\'t have any bad looking dust/dirt/blemishes on it and then moving it into place with the help of another person.  3. When the photographer is done with the current piece you would move that piece out and the next piece in (obviously with the help of another person if its big) and then put the finished piece back where it belongs in the warehouse. Also since this is a warehouse with often very high racks it is important to use common sense when putting something back stacking dining chairs etc - obviously we want to organize things in such a way that it is safe for everyone working here.  4. Also our wood shop frequently needs pieces found and moved so they can begin working on them.   5. And when a new truckload of furniture arrives at the warehouse it needs to be carefully unloaded processed and put in the proper location.  These 5 things are the major parts of every day.  The most important qualities you can have for this job is to show up on time have enough physical strength to move furniture around most of the day and a militant attitude toward organization and cleanliness of the furniture you are moving.  If you have the personal traits I described above and think you can handle this type of daily workflow well then I look forward to talking with you. Please e-mail me anything about yourself that would indicate you can excel at this position - AND PLEASE INCLUDE YOUR PHONE NUMBER - and if it is clear to me you are a good fit for the company and the job I will contact you right away.  Thank you for taking the time to read this ad.  Sincerely Greg

7394768756,Looking for work! I am a 24 year old college student looking for work. I am flexible with my schedule. I have reliable transportation and I learn quickly. I look forward to hearing from you. Thank you.,7406321973,Warehouse Floor Manager Trainee - Help Our Team Move Vintage Furniture (Countryside) We are a rapidly growing vintage furniture company here in Countryside looking for some new people to add to our warehouse team - specifically helping to carefully move pieces of furniture around the warehouse whenever different sections of our team need it.  There are several situations where furniture needs to be moved around and since this is vintage furniture it needs to always be handled with care:  1. Our photography studio frequently needs a steady stream of new pieces to take photos of - as trucks arrive to bring in furniture our processing team takes measurements documents any problems the piece might have and notes everything in our inventory system making sure each piece is properly tagged. Then these pieces go into a queue for the photography studio while some may go ahead and get moved back to our racks.  2. Our in-house wood shop needs pieces moved from their bays into the shop so they can work on restoring the pieces fixing everything up and making it look nice before shipment.  3. Re-organization. As pieces get sold and shipped out and new pieces are constantly coming in this causes the warehouse team to have to constantly think about organization and re-organizing the available space to make it all work out most efficiently. The people who are best at managing this are the people who get noticed and promoted the fastest.  If you are strong durable and have a good mind for organization then this is the perfect job to start out in and move up the scale. Some of our best people started out here and moved up quickly. You will be appreciated and rewarded for showing up and putting real thought into the work you do to support everyone on the team.  If you are interested please respond to this ad and let me know. My name is Greg and I look forward to hearing from you!  Thank you Greg,7404354789,Earn $15 - $30/hr delivering packages with Amazon Flex (Chicago) Earnings matter.

(Countryside IL) We are a growing vintage furniture company here in Countryside with a fairly large warehouse.  Inside this warehouse we\'re frequently shuffling around a lot of inventory every day - often fragile (and expensive!) pieces of cool vintage furniture from the 50\'s 60\'s and 70\'s.  Our photo studio in-house wood shop and shipping and receiving areas are constantly needing pieces moved in and out as everyone here does their jobs.  Keeping everything moving organized and inventoried is the name of the game and if you\'re the type of person who takes pride in being strong disciplined and organized we are looking for you.  My name is Greg and if what I just described sounds like something you could come in help manage and (eventually) take control over as you move up then I would love to hear from you.  This would be from 8am-4pm (sometimes 4:30pm) Monday through Friday and there is opportunity for growth here as you gain more experience and familiarity with our warehouse the furniture itself and how it is all organized.  At the start you would be an important part of helping to make sure our daily photography and wood shop workflow goes smoothly. You would be working with our warehouse floor supervisor who knows everything here well enough to direct exactly what needs to be done and when. Eventually if you master how everything works here and help everyone stay on track you can even BE warehouse floor supervisor.  Here is what your tasks would look like at the start:  1. Every morning we must ensure there is a piece of furniture in the studio ready to go so that the photographer can get straight to work without any delay. Depending on the circumstances this might mean getting it there immediately when you arrive in the morning or having it already in place at the end of the previous day.  2. While that piece is being photographed you would be helping get the next piece ready on our list. This involves looking at our list keeping it organized going to locate the next piece in the warehouse cleaning it up so that it doesn\'t have any bad looking dust/dirt/blemishes on it and then moving it into place with the help of another person.  3. When the photographer is done with the current piece you would move that piece out and the next piece in (obviously with the help of another person if its big) and then put the finished piece back where it belongs in the warehouse. Also since this is a warehouse with often very high racks it is important to use common sense when putting something back stacking dining chairs etc - obviously we want to organize things in such a way that it is safe for everyone working here.  4. Also our wood shop frequently needs pieces found and moved so they can begin working on them.   5. And when a new truckload of furniture arrives at the warehouse it needs to be carefully unloaded processed and put in the proper location.  These 5 things are the major parts of every day.  The most important qualities you can have for this job is to show up on time have enough physical strength to move furniture around most of the day and a militant attitude toward organization and cleanliness of the furniture you are moving.  If you have the personal traits I described above and think you can handle this type of daily workflow well then I look forward to talking with you. Please e-mail me anything about yourself that would indicate you can excel at this position - AND PLEASE INCLUDE YOUR PHONE NUMBER - and if it is clear to me you are a good fit for the company and the job I will contact you right away.

7406412541,Need a WordPress Expert? Are you looking for a WordPress expert or guru? I would love to help.   * I\'m local! I\'m happy to meet in person but happy to meet you virtually / work with anyone anywhere. * I\'ve been working with WordPress since 2000. I\'m an expert yet I\'m a great teacher and can make it easy to understand. * I thrive on building deep trusting relationships which allow me to help people make sense of complex things like technology and succeed.  Please don\'t hesitate to contact me. I love to chat and help.    ================================================,7406321406,Do you take pride in being disciplined and organized? (Countryside IL) We are a growing vintage furniture company here in Countryside with a fairly large warehouse.  Inside this warehouse we\'re frequently shuffling around a lot of inventory every day - often fragile (and expensive!) pieces of cool vintage furniture from the 50\'s 60\'s and 70\'s.  Our photo studio in-house wood shop and shipping and receiving areas are constantly needing pieces moved in and out as everyone here does their jobs.  Keeping everything moving organized and inventoried is the name of the game and if you\'re the type of person who takes pride in being strong disciplined and organized we are looking for you.  My name is Greg and if what I just described sounds like something you could come in help manage and (eventually) take control over as you move up then I would love to hear from you.  This would be from 8am-4pm (sometimes 4:30pm) Monday through Friday and there is opportunity for growth here as you gain more experience and familiarity with our warehouse the furniture itself and how it is all organized.  At the start you would be an important part of helping to make sure our daily photography and wood shop workflow goes smoothly. You would be working with our warehouse floor supervisor who knows everything here well enough to direct exactly what needs to be done and when. Eventually if you master how everything works here and help everyone stay on track you can even BE warehouse floor supervisor.  Here is what your tasks would look like at the start:  1. Every morning we must ensure there is a piece of furniture in the studio ready to go so that the photographer can get straight to work without any delay. Depending on the circumstances this might mean getting it there immediately when you arrive in the morning or having it already in place at the end of the previous day.  2. While that piece is being photographed you would be helping get the next piece ready on our list. This involves looking at our list keeping it organized going to locate the next piece in the warehouse cleaning it up so that it doesn\'t have any bad looking dust/dirt/blemishes on it and then moving it into place with the help of another person.  3. When the photographer is done with the current piece you would move that piece out and the next piece in (obviously with the help of another person if its big) and then put the finished piece back where it belongs in the warehouse. Also since this is a warehouse with often very high racks it is important to use common sense when putting something back stacking dining chairs etc - obviously we want to organize things in such a way that it is safe for everyone working here.  4. Also our wood shop frequently needs pieces found and moved so they can begin working on them.   5. And when a new truckload of furniture arrives at the warehouse it needs to be carefully unloaded processed and put in the proper location.  These 5 things are the major parts of every day.  The most important qualities you can have for this job is to show up on time have enough physical strength to move furniture around most of the day and a militant attitude toward organization and cleanliness of the furniture you are moving.  If you have the personal traits I described above and think you can handle this type of daily workflow well then I look forward to talking with you. Please e-mail me anything about yourself that would indicate you can excel at this position - AND PLEASE INCLUDE YOUR PHONE NUMBER - and if it is clear to me you are a good fit for the company and the job I will contact you right away.  Thank you for taking the time to read this ad.

7403983445,Social Media Marketer (Chicago) Hi! My name is Alexyss Rubjerg and I am a social media marketer!   I graduated with a business degree which really jump-started my drive. However my childhood dream was always to own multiple businesses so I guess I should credit that. I absolutely love working with other entrepreneurs. I figured since I was able to build my dream I should help others build theirs. I devise a strategy through intense research for each and every business I work with. There is not a one size fits all social media strategy and understanding that is key but I can help you find the one that works for your business.   Creating content and captions is a main part of what I do but engagement is by far the most important part of how I help clients. Engagement helps your followers get a more personal view of you and helps them feel connected thus bringing back more business regardless of if you are a service provider or sell products. Engagement is also one of the hardest things for business owners to do since it can take up so much time. That is why I am here to help!   If you are struggling with social media for your business or even if you aren\'t and you just want to outsource it then visit my website and schedule a consultation! During that consult we will go over your difficulties and your goals so that I can craft a strategy unique to you!   alexyssrubjerg.com,7405790313,(Remote) Phone Sales \xf0\x9f\x93\x9e GREAT COMMISSIONS \xf0\x9f\x93\x9e Daily Direct Deposits (Nationwide) THIS IS A WORK FROM HOME POSITION WHERE YOU\'LL COLD CALL REAL ESTATE AGENTS WITH OUR ADVANCED INTERNET-BASED DIALING SYSTEM TO OFFER THEM A FREE 7 TRIAL OF OUR SERVICE...

I\'ve been on both sides of business. I spent 13 years taking all of the money I made bartending and dumping it into a business model that wasn\'t built for the average person to succeed only to fail 12 times. I finally gave up on the idea of being my own boss and got a "real job". That lasted about 6 months until a guy came into the bar and introduced me to lucky #13. This one was different it was so different that I didn\'t understand it. All I knew is what I saw which was a room full of people making money which I had never seen before so I started my business and the rest is history. This business has paid my wife and I over 2.4 MILLION in residual/ongoing income and has allowed us to help a lot of others generate a significant ongoing income as well.  If you are open to the idea of selling and recruiting for yourself are coachable and willing to follow a proven business plan part-time (10-15 hours/week) then please text me and I will get you more information. Serious inquiries only please. My wife and I can only work with one new business partner each quarter. For immediate consideration submit a resume and contact information.

7405594317,Real Estate (Gurnee) Greetings  I recently passed the Illinois real estate broker exam. I am an English-Spanish bilingual and a graduate of Northeastern Illinois University.  I am looking for a sponsoring broker.  May I hear from you?  Many thanks PMG,7405843973,Broker/Leasing Agent A.K.A. Apartment Locator (Chicago) Who are we? ChicagosBestRentals.com   What are we looking for? New agents to join the team.  Does it matter if you\'re now currently licensed or have never done anything in real estate before? No. In fact those agents tend to do better as they look at this from a new perspective and don\'t think too much! Plus we offer full on-boarding training and mentoring.  However you will need an Illinois Residential Real Estate License. This requires a $240 weekend course (remote no webcam) and $155 to take the state exam. (Although you can begin working before you take the exam as testing centers are a bit backed up. You have 120 days to pass the state exam once you complete the weekend real estate course).   We rebate you $240 for the real estate course once you join our team.   How to Apply? Please email your resume and your general availability for a quick 15-minute phone call (No zoom don\'t worry). If you don\'t have a resume ready but are interested simply text me Anthony at (5 1 2) 3 7 8 - 3 8 7 3 and let me know you\'d like to discuss the Apartment Locator position.   The Details:   This is a semi-remote commission-based position that requires a real estate license (Don\'t worry the course to get your license is done over the weekend is remote and your webcam is NOT required.   (We also rebate the cost of $240 to you for the course once you join our team).  What does semi-remote commission-based mean?   It means you work from home as a real estate agent posting ads on Marketplace and Craigslist (with our help) and referring those clients to the apartment communities they inquired on. The only in-person work you\'re required to do is meet the client at the apartment and the on-site agent will show the client the apartments.
