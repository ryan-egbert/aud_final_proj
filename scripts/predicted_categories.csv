1134,0,"Social Media Marketer (Chicago) Hi! My name is Alexyss Rubjerg and I am a social media marketer!   I graduated with a business degree which really jump-started my drive. However, my childhood dream was always to own multiple businesses so I guess I should credit that. I absolutely love working with other entrepreneurs. I figured since I was able to build my dream I should help others build theirs. I devise a strategy through intense research for each and every business I work with. There is not a one size fits all social media strategy and understanding that is key, but I can help you find the one that works for your business.   Creating content and captions is a main part of what I do but engagement is by far the most important part of how I help clients. Engagement helps your followers get a more personal view of you and helps them feel connected, thus bringing back more business regardless of if you are a service provider or sell products. Engagement is also one of the hardest things for business owners to do since it can take up so much time. That is why I am here to help!   If you are struggling with social media for your business, or even if you aren\'t and you just want to outsource it then visit my website and schedule a consultation! During that consult we will go over your difficulties and your goals so that I can craft a strategy unique to you!   alexyssrubjerg.com",7403983445,12,sales
