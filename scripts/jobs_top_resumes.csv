In the United States alone the contract staffing industry is a $200 billion dollar industry that\xe2\x80\x99s extremely fragmented amongst thousands of sub-scale temporary staffing agencies. Whereas companies like Upwork make hiring freelancers for gig projects a breeze when companies need W-2 contractors they turn to agencies who rely on an army of recruiters to manually recruit candidates resulting in long fill times low fill rates and eye-popping markups (markups frequently reach 60-100% of each hour billed!). Employing those contractors is often even more painful than recruiting them. Whereas companies like Gusto and Zenefits help SMBs employ their direct hires offering a turnkey solution for onboarding payroll and benefits agencies employing contractors require their clients to interface with manual processes and rickety point solutions. And that\xe2\x80\x99s to say nothing of the employment experience for contractors themselves who often lack access to affordable benefits paid time off paid holidays and other basics of a strong compensation package.\xc2\xa0HireArt\xe2\x80\x99s all-in-one tool has helped hundreds of great companies including Toyota Research Institute Facebook Nasdaq and Lyft build and manage amazing teams of W2 contractors.
